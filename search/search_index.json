The whole stack is now open source, now that HPE have generously provided libcxi, their contribution to libfabric and other low level dependencies.</p> <p>The open source products are still a bit raw, without versioning and requiring patches to work around compilation and runtime issues. The aim of this work is to document how to set up a stable software stack that is production ready, and drive collaboration between HPE and customers towards a robust, well-defined implementation.</p>"}]}
